*Description*

Rosa gives users the location and operation hours of the flower shops, recommend special flowers and bouquets for special occasions and aids the user in purchasing them. I used IBM's Watson Studio to create it
as Watson Studio allows you to easily create models and algorithms without needing to code. I want to add a feature that would allow users to interact with Rosa via voice chat.

*How to Install Rosa*

1.) Download my Flower Shop Assistant from my page.

2.) Create an account on IBM Cloud OR login to IBM Cloud.

3.) Click on the 'Catalog' tab and type in 'Watson Assistant' in the search bar.

4.) Select 'watsonx Assistant' and create your assistant.

5.) After creating your assistant, click 'Assistant Settings' on the left menu.

6.) Scroll to the Download/Upload section and click 'Download/Upload files'.

7.) Click the upload tab and leave the 'Assitant only' option checked. Then click the 'Drag and drop file here or click to select a file' link
