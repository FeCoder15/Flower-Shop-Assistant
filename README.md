Flower Shop Virtual Assistant Rosa

Description

Rosa gives users the location and operation hours of the flower shops, recommend special flowers and bouquets for special occasions and aids the user in purchasing them. I used IBM's Watson Studio to create it
as Watson Studio allows you to easily create models and algorithms without needing to code. I want to add a feature that would allow users to interact with Rosa via voice chat.
